The goal of this project is to build a more immersive and beginner friendly UI for creating music with [Strudel.js](https://strudel.cc)

Initial ideas:

- [ ] Sound library imports
- [ ] Code imports
- [ ] Individual input blocks per stack
- [ ] Enable/disable blocks (and only take affect on next phrase)
- [ ] BPM/timesignature slider
- [ ] Midi device listing + clock management
- [ ] Easy crossfade between blocks (with midi automation?!?)
- [ ] ???
